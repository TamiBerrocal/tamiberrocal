### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

*As you may have already noticed*, my name is __Tami Berrocal__ and, most of the time, I'm a __front-end developer__ :woman_technologist:. The rest of the time you'll find me watching movies/series, listening to ~~music~~ __The Beatles__ or shooting film with my beautiful Pentax Spotmatic SP :camera:.

I study information systems engineering and I also work at [Medallia](https://www.medallia.com/). I volunteer at Women Who Code, chapter Buenos Aires, too.

My __pronouns__ are: _ella, she, her_
